This folder contains our empirical data and code that are able to reproduce the results of Fig4 and Fig5.

"FAV_hv_data.csv" is the data file contains moth species level traits and corresponding ambient temperatures. In specific:

Elev_up: Upper distribution limit
Elev_low: Lower distribution limit
Elev_mid: Mid-point of upper and lower distribution limits
RS: Range size (Elev_up - Elev_low)
W_length: Forewing length
B_length: Body length
Weight: Dry weight
CTmax, CTmin: Critical thermal maximum / minimum
TTrange: Thermal tolerance range (CTmax - CTmin)
STmax: Average max temperature of the warmest month
STmin: Average min temperature of the coldest month
STR: Seasonal temperature range (STmax - STmin)
STmean: Average mean annual temperature
Location: Location where the species was collected
DTmax: Diurnal maximum temperature
DTmin: Diurnal minimum temperature
DTR: Diurnal temperature range (DTmax - DTmin)
DTmean: Diurnal mean temperature
Group: Group which species correspond to when applying assemblage-level analyses. For the meaning of the codes, please refer to Fig.4a in the article.
